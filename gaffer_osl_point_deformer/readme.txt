Please install/copy the compiled osl file (mmPointDeformerDisplace.oso) to your Gaffer shader folder to be picked up
before you open the scene

Once you have installed the .oso deformer you can open point_deformer_sampleScene_v001.gfr and repath the files and gaffer reference to your local downloaded files.
Alternatively, after installing the .oso you can just import the point deformer from /gaffer_osl_point_deformer/gaffer_reference/osl_point_deformer.grf as a Gaffer reference and you are good to go.
